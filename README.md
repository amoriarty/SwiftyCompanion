## TODO
* Handle errors if token authentication failed.
* Handle errors when requested login failed.
* Manage user "title" in profile navigation view.

## Way of possibles
* Center 42 logo on launchscreen, then animate it to make it take the place it actually have (or disappear if the iPhone is in landscape mode).
